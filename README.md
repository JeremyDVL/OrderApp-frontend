# Restaurant Ordering App

A full-stack App built with React and a mix of different technologies, the original app was built locally with NextJS, Strapi v3, and Mongo the repo is built with
NextJS, Strapi v4 and PostgreSQL.  Strapi no longer works with Mongo in v4 and I could not deploy the app without updated the node version which did not work with v3.


## Description

This full-sack MERN/PERN app will let you see menus from different restaurants, add different items from all restuaurants to your cart and checkout with your user account using Stripe.

Includes a Search Bar, different dishes per restaurant and cart manages orders from different restaurants.

On the backend, users, restaurants and menu information can be easily managed via Strapi.
